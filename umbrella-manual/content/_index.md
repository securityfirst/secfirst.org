## About

Umbrella is an all-in-one app for digital and physical security. 
It teaches about the latest risks and how to mitigate them. 
Umbrella is designed for and used by journalists, aid workers, human rights activists, and people travelling in high-risk areas. 

Umbrella provides step-by-step advice to help you and your team operate safely in a hostile environment. 
Whether you are sending sensitive emails, attending a protest or dealing with a kidnapping, 
Umbrella is your one stop shop for the latest security tools and information.

There are lessons on various topics and checklists to help you follow through. 
Keep track of your progress in the dashboard. 
Use forms to fill and share important information. 
Feeds update you with threat alerts from trusted sources.

Your data is encrypted on your device, so no one else has access to it. 
Feel free to add extra security with a password. 
In an emergency, disguise Umbrella or integrate it with _Ripple_, a "Panic Button" app by the _Guardian Project_ that you can download separately to hide it with a single swipe.

The final screen shows you a summarized version of Umbrella's **Terms and Conditions**. 
Read through the **Terms and Conditions** and accept them to proceed.

Tap **OK** to download more content. 

![Download additional content](/img/download-more-content.png)

After the content is done downloading, choose what security guide you need most, or explore on your own, if you prefer.

Note that doing this significatly diminishes your safety in regards with any identifiable data you input into Umbrella. 

When you set a password, you will be prompted to enter it everytime you launch the Umbrella app. 

![Password prompt](/img/password-prompt.png)

## Feeds

The feeds dashboard contains security feeds from places like the UN Relief Web and the US Centers for Disease Control. You enter your location (and how often you want to be updated). Every a new update is released (e.g a disease outbreak in your location), the information comes up on the dashboard.

### Feed

The Feed keeps you up to date with the current risks in your area, helping you monitor local threats with live security alerts from trusted sources. 
The content you see on your feed depends on the country and sources you set. 

To begin setting your feed, click on the **Set Now** button, under the **Set your feed** card. 

![Set your feed](/img/set-feed.png)

A popup appears, requesting for an interval. 
The interval dertermines how often your feed will be updated with new content from the source(s). 
Enter your preferred interval in minutes and tap **OK** to continue. 

![Enter feed interval](/img/enter-interval.png)

Next, enter a location and tap **OK**. 
You will only get alerts related to the location (country) you pick. 
There is no geolocation or tracking of your input location. 
We can’t see it, and neither can anyone else.

![Enter feed location](/img/enter-location.png)

Finally, select your prefered feed sources and tap **OK**. The sources you select will determine the nature of the content in your feed. 

These are the sources that we currently include for real-time updated security feeds. For privacy reasons, users never connect directly to these services. We are always looking for more useful sources that will help users keep updated on the move.

- [ReliefWeb / UN](http://reliefweb.int): excellent physical security updates that amalgamate information from the UN and various NGOs - though not available in every country
- [Foreign and Commonwealth Office](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/foreign-commonwealth-office): foreign travel advice, consular help and services abroad and document legislation
- [Centers for Disease Control](https://www.cdc.gov): updates on disease and health warnings
- [Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System](http://www.gdacs.org): updates on natural disaster issues such as floods, earthquakes and tsunamis
- [US State Department Country Warnings](https://www.state.gov/travel/): updates mainly focused on the security situation for travellers and internationals - available for every country

![Select feed sources](/img/select-feed-sources.png)

That's it. Your feed should now be populated with content, ordered by newest content first.

![Feed populated with alerts](/img/sample-feed.png)

Tapping on feed card will open a page with more information about the event, directly in the Umbrella app. 

{{< figure src="/img/open-feed-alert.png" link="/img/open-feed-alert.png"
class="fullwidth" alt="Open feed alert" >}}

You may change your feed location, interval and sources at any time, using the **Set** buttons under their respective sections. 

![Set Interval, location and feed sources](/img/set-interval-location-source.png)

### RSS

RSS feeds show you recently-posted content from blogs and websites you choose to follow. 
While a Feed is dependent on location and specific sources, an RSS feed shows all new content from any website. 
You are encouraged to add your own RSS feeds for customised updates. 

Navigate to the **RSS** tab of the feed page. 
By default, Umbrella provides RSS feeds from popular news websites like BBC and Threadpost.

![Default RSS websites](/img/default-rss.png)

Click on a source to see the RSS feed from that website. 

To add more RSS feeds, tap the plus icon (**+**) at the bottom right of the RSS screen.

![Add new RSS feed](/img/add-rsss.png)

Then, enter a link to the RSS feed into the **Feed Source** field, then tap **OK**. 

![Enter RSS feed source](/img/rss-feed-source.png)

For each post on the RSS feed, you can share using the **Share** button or view more information using the **Learn More** button. You may read the full post without even leaving the Umbrella app. 

{{< figure src="/img/open-rss-post.png" link="/img/open-rss-post.png"
class="fullwidth" alt="Open RSS post" >}}

## Forms

Forms enable you to compile secure itineraries and protocols, which can be shared with your team. 

Forms allow a user to quickly fill out and share important information about issues such as their travel plan in a high risk location or report on a digital/physical security incident.

### Filling a form

Tap on the  **Forms** tab from the bottom navigation menu to visit the forms page. 
Umbrella provides four default forms, and they can be filled as many times as you want. 

![Available forms](/img/forms.png)

* **Physical Security Incident:** Used to report a physical security event.
* **Proof of life Form:** Used to show that an individual was alive at the time the form was completed.
* **Travel Security Memo:** Used to document safety precautions taken before travelling.
* **Digital Security Incident:** Used to report a digital security event, where an organization's systems or data have been compromised or that measures put in place to protect them have failed.

Tap on any of the available forms to begin filling it. The information you're required to fill depends on the type of form. 

Enter information into the fields and tap on **Next** to proceed to the next section of the form. You can also go back to edit your previous answers with the **Back** button. As you complete a form, a percentage indicates how far you have gone.

![Filling a form](/img/fill-form.png)

You can exit a form anytime by clicking on the back arrow icon at the top left of the screen. Umbrella automatically saves how far you've gone. Once you have started filling a form, it is shown on the Forms page, under the **Filled our forms** section. You may edit it, share it or delete it. 

![Filled out forms](/img/filled-out-forms.png)

The same form can be filled multiple times. 

**Note**: Since forms ask for personally-identifiable information, it is advisable to set up a password for Umbrella app, to prevent unauthorized people who have your device from accessing your data. Navigate to **Account** --> **Set password** to set a password.

## Make Umbrella work for you

Imagine we have a team called **K**. K is running a team spread across three countries. Staff have various levels of training — in some cases, none at all. 
Risk levels vary, from sources who require total anonymity, to an office administrator with no field experience and limited digital expertise beyond Microsoft Office. Here are some different ways for K to make use of Umbrella:

| Option | Description | Cost |
| --- | ----------- | ----|
| _Adapt_ | Download Umbrella | Free |
| _Customize_ | Build your own security app | Developer skills required |
| _White Label_ | Secure app for your brand/content | Request a quote|

### Adapt Umbrella

Umbrella was designed to meet the needs of people from different sectors operating at various levels of risk. 

To adapt Umbrella for the needs of the team, K should: 

- Point team members towards the most appropriate lessons and tool guides. 
- Warn of any deviation from existing policies to avoid confusion. 
- Take mitigating action if having Umbrella on a particular device could increase risk.
- Review legal and insurance requirements for security or duty of care to incorporate Umbrella.
- Umbrella should complement and streamline K’s security strategy. It can’t replace a proactive security manager. 

### Customise Umbrella with Tent

K wants to put existing policies in a secure app. 
K has a technical background and a colleague in IT who’s up for a challenge.
They build their own version of Umbrella at minimal cost using open-source tools, including Security First’s mobile CMS, [Tent](https://secfirst.org/tent/).

Tent contains all the tools you need to create, edit, and publish securely-under one roof.

### White label Umbrella with Tent
K’s manager can contract Security First to white label Umbrella with the organisation’s own brand and content — no technical background required.

Request more details or a quote at [info@secfirst.org](mailto:info@secfirst.org).
