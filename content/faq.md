         <h3 class="green">Why is it called Umbrella? </h3>
         <p>The name stems from the word "umbrella", defined by Oxford Languages as, <em>"a device consisting of a circular canopy of cloth on a folding metal frame supported by a central rod, used as protection against rain"</em> or <em>"a protecting force or influence"</em>.</p>
         <p>In the same way, the Umbrella app aims to protect you from risks by providing information on what to do in any given security situation and the tools to do it.</p>

         <h3 class="green">How is Umbrella different from other apps? </h3>
         <p>Unlike other applications that provide security lessons, Umbrella goes above and beyond with its features. Umbrella is a one-stop place for information on what to do in any given security situation and the tools to do it. Apart from security lessons and tool guides, Umbrella provides many other <a href="/faq/#what-can-i-do-with-umbrella">additional features</a>.</p>

         <h3 class="green">Should I use a password with Umbrella? Can I reset it? </h3>
         <p>If you want to save your checklists and keep an eye on your progress, we recommend you use a strong password. If someone gets their hands on your phone, you don’t want them to review your security protocols. We haven’t made this compulsory in case you weren’t storing much, but we think you’re better safe than sorry.</p>
         <p>Anything you input into Umbrella is only stored on your device. We can’t see it or give it to anyone else. We also can’t recover your data if you accidently delete it or forget your password.</p>
